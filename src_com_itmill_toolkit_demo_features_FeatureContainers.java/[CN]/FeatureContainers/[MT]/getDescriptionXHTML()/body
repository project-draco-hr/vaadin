Each "+ "item is identified by an item id. "+ "Properties can be requested from container with item "+ "and property ids. Other way of accessing properties is to first "+ "request an item from container and then request its properties "+ "from it. </p>"+ "<p>Container interface was designed with flexibility and "+ "efficiency in mind. It contains inner interfaces for ordering "+ "the items sequentially, indexing the items and accessing them "+ "hierarchically. Those ordering models provide basis for "+ "Table, Tree and Select UI components. As with other data "+ "models, the containers support events for notifying about the "+ "changes.</p>"+ "<p>Set of utilities for converting between container models by "+ "adding external indexing or hierarchy into existing containers. "+ "In memory containers implementing indexed and hierarchical "+ "models provide easy to use tools for setting up in memory data "+ "storages. There is even a hierarchical container for direct "+ "file system access.</p>";
