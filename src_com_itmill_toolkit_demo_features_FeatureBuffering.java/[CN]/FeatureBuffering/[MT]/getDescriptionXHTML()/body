  return "<p>IT Mill Toolkit data model provides interface for implementing " + "buffering in data components. The basic idea is that a component " + "reading their state from data source can implement "+ "Buffered-interface, for storing the value internally. "+ "Buffering provides transactional access "+ "for setting data: data can be put to a component's buffer and "+ "afterwards committed to or discarded by re-reding it from the data source. "+ "The buffering can be used for creating interactive interfaces "+ "as well as caching the data for performance reasons.</p>"+ "<p>Buffered interface contains methods for committing and discarding "+ "changes to an object and support for controlling buffering mode "+ "with read-through and write-through modes. "+ "Read-through mode means that the value read from the buffered "+ "object is constantly up to date with the data source. "+ "Respectively the write-through mode means that all changes to the object are "+ "immediately updated to the data source.</p>";
